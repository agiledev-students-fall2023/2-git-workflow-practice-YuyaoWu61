# [Architecture, Performance, and Games](https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/architecture-performance-and-games.html)

This is an introduction for a book about game programming patterns, but the gist can be applied to all fields of software development. The article lists reasons why we need software architectures, compares the costs and outcomes, and introduces the concept of the balance between performance, speed, and quality. It's quite fascinating to hear about the author's opinions on choosing which kind of architecture depending on the project and balancing the trade-offs with different design patterns. The idea of choosing the best and the most suitable structure is a valuable lesson for real-life practices, especially video games development, which requires good performance, good user experience, and clear game design goal communication as a whole experience to players. The article succuessfuy conveys the beauty of balancing to the audience.

## Comment on the Article by Gayatri Rithe 
I enjoyed reading the article! It does a good job explaining the trade offs between having good code flexibility and performance when developing a game. Striking that balance may be hard, but will be rewarding in both performance and convenience.
